# wavGUIsimple
A project that implements a GUI interface for opening and applying digital signal processing techniques to WAV files, done as part of my 3rd year university project.  
Hasn't been built in a long while or maintained, so the project may use features of libraries that are depreciated in their current versions.  
There may be a few swear words in old commits.
